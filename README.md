# ENG3000 Refactored Marble Machine Code
## Description
The project involved refactoring the existing Arduino codebase for a marble machine to enhance its efficiency, maintainability, and overall performance. The objective was to streamline the code, ensuring it aligns with the best practices of functional programming and object-oriented design, thereby improving the machine's reliability and functionality 
so that it could handle running for an extended period of time easier.

## Tasks Accomplished
- Adherence to Functional and OOP Paradigms: Revamped the code structure to strictly follow functional programming and object-oriented principles. This included encapsulating related functionalities, minimizing side effects, and promoting code reusability.
- Component Access Control: Restructured the codebase to ensure that each component has access only to the areas relevant to its functionality. This reduced the complexity and interdependencies between different parts of the system.
- Code Duplication Elimination: Identified and eliminated duplicate code blocks. Refactored common functionalities into separate files and functions, enhancing the code's readability and maintainability.
- Modularity and Readability Enhancement: Broke down complex code segments into smaller, modular pieces. Organized these modules into separate files with clear, concise naming conventions, making the codebase more navigable and easier to understand.
